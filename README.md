The quality of solar resource data is critical for economic and technical assessment of solar power installation. Understanding uncertainty and managing weather-related risk are essential for successful planning and operating of solar electricity assets.

The assessment of radiation arriving on an inclined surface, using global horizontal data as input, raises two main problems; 
- first, to separate the GHI into their direct and diffuse components (decomposition) and, 
- second, from them, to estimate the radiation components falling on an inclined surface (transposition). 

## Parameters
To solve these problems, it is important to describe in detail parameters such as:
declination angle, solar hour angle, solar zenith, solar altitude, solar azimuth, angle of incidence, 
solar constant, extraterrestrial irradiance over the horizontal surface, clearness index, and diffuse fraction index.
